## About
`pecs` is a plugin for [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org) that allows you to execute code asynchronously
by chaining multiple promises as part of Bevy's `ecs` environment.

`pecs` stands for `Promise Entity Component System`.

### Features
- Promise chaining with `then()`/`then_repeat()`
- State passing (`state` for promises is like `self` for items).
- Complete type inference (the next promise knows the type of the previous result).
- Out-of-the-box timer, UI and HTTP promises via stateless `asyn` mod and
  stateful  `state.asyn()` method.
- Custom promise registration (add any asynchronous function you want!).
- [System parameters](https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/ecs/system/trait.SystemParam.html) fetching
  (promise `asyn!` functions accept the same parameters as Bevy systems do).
- Nested promises (with chaining, obviously).
- Combining promises with `any/all` for tuple/vec of promises via stateless `Promise::any()`
  /`Promise::all()` methods or stateful `state.any()`/`state.all()` methods.
- State mapping via `with(value)`/`map(func)` (changes state type/value over chain calls).
- Result mapping via `with_result(value)`/`map_result(func)` (changes result type/value over chain calls).

## Example
There is the output of the above example, pay some attention to time stamps:
```text
18.667 INFO bevy_render::renderer: AdapterInfo { ... }
18.835 INFO simple: Wait a second..
19.842 INFO simple: How large is is the Bevy main web page?
19.924 INFO simple: It is 17759 bytes!
19.924 INFO simple: It tooks 1.09s to do this job.
19.924 INFO simple: Exiting now
```

## Work in Progress
This crate is pretty young. API could and will change. The app may crash. Some
promises could silently drop. Documentation is incomplete.

But. But. Examples work like a charm. And this fact gives us a lot of hope.


## License

The `pecs` is dual-licensed under either:

- MIT License ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or [http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT))

This means you can select the license you prefer!
This dual-licensing approach is the de-facto standard in the Rust ecosystem and there are [very good reasons](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/2373) to include both.
