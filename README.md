## About
`pecs` is a plugin for [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org) that allows you to execute code asynchronously
by chaining multiple promises as part of Bevy's `ecs` environment.

`pecs` stands for `Promise Entity Component System`.

Compatibility:
| bevy | pecs |
|------|------|
| 0.11 | 0.4  |
| 0.10 | 0.3  |
| 0.9  | 0.2  |

### Features
- Promise chaining with `then()`/`then_repeat()`
- State passing (`state` for promises is like `self` for items).
- Complete type inference (the next promise knows the type of the previous result).
- Out-of-the-box timer, UI and HTTP promises via stateless `asyn` mod and
  stateful  `state.asyn()` method.
- Custom promise registration (add any asynchronous function you want!).
- [System parameters](https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/ecs/system/trait.SystemParam.html) fetching
  (promise `asyn!` functions accept the same parameters as Bevy systems do).
- Nested promises (with chaining, obviously).
- Combining promises with `any/all` for tuple/vec of promises via stateless `Promise::any()`
  /`Promise::all()` methods or stateful `state.any()`/`state.all()` methods.
- State mapping via `with(value)`/`map(func)` (changes state type/value over chain calls).
- Result mapping via `with_result(value)`/`map_result(func)` (changes result type/value over chain calls).

## Example
```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;
use pecs::prelude::*;
fn main() {
    App::new()
        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
        .add_plugin(PecsPlugin)
        .add_systems(Startup, setup)
        .run();
}

fn setup(mut commands: Commands, time: Res<Time>) {
    let start = time.elapsed_seconds();
    commands
        // create PromiseLike chainable commands
        // with the current time as state
        .promise(|| start)
        // will be executed right after current stage
        .then(asyn!(state => {
            info!("Wait a second..");
            state.asyn().timeout(1.0)
        }))
        // will be executed after in a second after previous call
        .then(asyn!(state => {
            info!("How large is is the Bevy main web page?");
            state.asyn().http().get("https://bevyengine.org")
        }))
        // will be executed after request completes
        .then(asyn!(state, result => {
            match result {
                Ok(response) => info!("It is {} bytes!", response.bytes.len()),
                Err(err) => info!("Ahhh... something goes wrong: {err}")
            }
            state.pass()
        }))
        // will be executed right after the previous one
        .then(asyn!(state, time: Res<Time> => {
            let duration = time.elapsed_seconds() - state.value;
            info!("It tooks {duration:0.2}s to do this job.");
            info!("Exiting now");
            asyn::app::exit()
        }));
}
```
There is otput of the above example, pay some attention to time stamps:
```text
18.667 INFO bevy_render::renderer: AdapterInfo { ... }
18.835 INFO simple: Wait a second..
19.842 INFO simple: How large is is the Bevy main web page?
19.924 INFO simple: It is 17759 bytes!
19.924 INFO simple: It tooks 1.09s to do this job.
19.924 INFO simple: Exiting now
```

## Work in Progress
This crate is pretty young. API could and will change. App may crash. Some
promises could silently drop. Documentation is incomplete.

But. But. Examples works like a charm. And this fact gives us a lot of hope.

This means you can select the license you prefer!
This dual-licensing approach is the de-facto standard in the Rust ecosystem and there are [very good reasons](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/2373) to include both.
